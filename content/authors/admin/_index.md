I’m a M.S. Candidate working with Prof.Kwanghoon Sohn at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University, Republic of Korea. I'm interested in deploying Computer Vision and Machine Learning models to the real Open-World which contains situations that are dynamic, vast, never-before-seen, and unpredictable.
