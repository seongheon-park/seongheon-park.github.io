Research on artificial intelligence technology that can mimic various human abilities by using image/video, voice/audio, and text/natural language, which are the basis of artificial intelligence.

Complex and comprehensive scene understanding using multimodal signals, user understanding, virtual space-time synthesis technology, and development of a general-purpose social artificial intelligence system through the integration of these technologies.
